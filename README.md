# DisableFlagSecure

An [Xposed Framework](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer) module that disables [`FLAG_SECURE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_SECURE) on windows system-wide. This lets you take screenshots and do screen capture in apps that normally won't let you. (That said, you probably don't want to leave this on permanently).

Get it from the [repository](http://repo.xposed.info/module/fi.veetipaananen.android.disableflagsecure).
